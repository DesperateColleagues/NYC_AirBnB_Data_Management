# NYC_AirBnB_Data_Management

A data management project that extracts useful information from a dataset of AirBnB New York City hosts.

## Where to find the Datasets

The datasets can be found in the **datasets** folder. A few notes about it:

- **datasets**: contains all the datasets of the project
- **datasets/csv_datasets**: contains the datasets (in csv format) that needs to be cleaned before being used (this operation is performed inside the cleaning folder). Here there is a brief description of them:
  
  - Airbnb_Open_Data.csv: contains the observations made for BnB houses in NYC;
  - subway_stops.csv: contains information about the stop of NYC subways
- **datasets/spatial_datasets_zipped**: contains all the spatial datasets. The data are zipped since their dimension is not supported by GitHub.
